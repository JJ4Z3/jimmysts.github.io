          <h3>
            Like A Dragon 8 Is About "The Yakuza World And Its Necessary Evils"
            Says RGG Studio Head
          </h3>
          <p>
            With the next installment in the series, Ryu ga Gotoku Studio will
            officially do away with the Yakuza name. The studio recently
            announced three new games, each of which distinctly lack the iconic
            'Yakuza' name, instead using a translation of the traditional
            Japanese name of the series – Like a Dragon. According to producer
            Masayoshi Yokoyama, the studio did so because, "we are talking about
            [the] criminal underworld, but we're not talking about Yakuza".

            <br /><br />

            Like a Dragon 8 has been announced, but we don't know much about the
            plot. However, in an interview compiled and translated by RGG
            fansite, Dojima's Dragon Girl, Yokoyama gave a brief glimpse of what
            the game could be based on.

            <br /><br />
            "It’s not about the past characters, but rather about the
            “business”. The yakuza world and its necessary evils," he said.
            "They were all part of that world, and it contained all kinds of
            good and evil, didn’t it? That’s what the Ryu ga Gotoku series has
            been about all this time. In Ryu ga Gotoku 7, we showed you how the
            underworld lost its power, with the decline of Tojo Kai and the
            dissolution of the yakuza. As Ryu ga Gotoku 8 is the sequel to Ryu
            ga Gotoku 7, it will continue that story, and show you how the
            underworld moves on and cleans itself up."

          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            In another interview, Yokoyama also said that moving forward, there
            will be no streaming restrictions on the series. While he wasn't too
            happy with the decision because of the potential spoilers, he
            accepted that it is a necessity. "It’s because the times have
            changed. To be honest, it’s not like the restrictions stopped
            anything anyway, people always find a way, don’t they?" he said,
            following with a smoking related analogy.
            <br />
            <br />
            "I said when we made 7 that we hoped it would be a game that would
            make people want to play it for themselves, even if they’d seen all
            the spoilers already. So I’ll be happy if there are people out there
            who think, “I watched the whole of 7 online, and it was great, so
            maybe I’ll buy 8 and play it myself.” In the end, the best
            entertainment isn’t watching, it’s playing it yourself."
