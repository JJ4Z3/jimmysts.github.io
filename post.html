            7 things we learned from 15 minutes of Yakuza: Like a Dragon
            gameplay
          </h3>
          <p>
            Yakuza: Like a Dragon came out in Japan in January, but we're still
            waiting for it—impatiently—to make it over to the West in English.
            I'm not sure if this gameplay video from IGN's Summer Gaming Expo
            makes it easier or harder, but it is at least full of very good
            Yakuza tidbits.

            <br /><br />

            Here are some things about Yakuza: Like a Dragon you probably don't
            know, unless you've been closely following reactions to the Japanese
            release.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The game's turn-based JRPG combat, which includes a job system,
                all takes place in the protagonist's head. He's imagining real
                fights as these absurd encounters full of special moves.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You can level up bonds between characters, called "drink links,"
                and with higher bonds they'll do follow-up attacks for you in
                combat.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>There are 19 jobs, each with their own unique outfits.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The new setting, Yokohama, is substantially larger than past
                Yakuza game areas. It's divided into nine districts, each with
                their own vibes and threat levels which affect how hard combat
                will be.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                One of your party members carries a guitar and attacks by
                pulling a CD out of his vest and throwing it. It does more
                damage if you tap a button at the right moment (think Paper
                Mario).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There's a significant business management mode where you take
                over a "failing confectionery company" and turn it into a "great
                holdings company." That process will apparently include some
                "epic shareholder battles."
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You can level up bonds between characters, called "drink links,"
                and with higher bonds they'll do follow-up attacks for you in
                combat.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Like a Dragon doesn't have a release date set for the West just yet,
            but in the interview above Sega's localization producer said it will
            be there "day one" for the launch of the Xbox Series X, and also on
            Xbox One, PS4, and Steam. That's not as specific as we hoped for,
            but it at least narrows the window down to sometime this holiday
            season.
