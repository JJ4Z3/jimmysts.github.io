            RGG Studio debut a docuseries delving into Like A Dragon 8's
            development
          </h3>
          <p>
            Documentaries chronicling game development are great. With so much
            marketing fluff surrounding games, it can be nice to hear directly
            from the devs about their inspirations, struggles, and creative
            intentions. Hearing them chat candidly, making jokes and getting
            excited, is a good reminder that real-life people are at the heart
            of every game - what a crazy concept. Luckily, these types of
            documentaries seem to be increasingly common, evidenced by the
            Yakuza (or Like A Dragon) docuseries that just debuted on YouTube.

            The docuseries is called Behind The Scenes Of Like A Dragon and it
            follows RGG Studio through a “generational shift” as they begin
            development on Like A Dragon 8 in 2021. The first episode is a brisk
            20-minute insight into how RGG approaches the first stages of
            development, focusing on the details that go into motion capture,
            and all of the tiny VO considerations that make the series so
            endearing. Yakuza is consistently entertaining, even in its most
            mundane scenes, so it’s nice to see the thought process that leads
            to that magic. So far, only the first episode is available, but I
            assume the series will have weekly releases.

            <br /><br />

            While the show details the minutiae that goes into development, it
            hasn’t delved into the emotional journey of the developers, yet. The
            recent 32-part Psychonauts 2 series has done an incredible job
            exploring the office dramas, heartbreak, and joy that come with game
            dev, and hopefully, we get a similar ride with the team at RGG.

            <br /><br />
            The docuseries doesn’t reveal too much about the mysterious Like A
            Dragon 8, although Yakuza fans aren’t starved for games at the
            moment. Like A Dragon Ishin launched just the other day, and our Ed
            had a great time with the 1800s prequel. In his review, Ed said,
            “Ishin feels most like Yakuza 0 (my fave) that's sure to please
            longtime fans.” He continued, “its standalone nature means that it
            is, without a doubt, one of the strongest starting points for
            newcomers.” If you are one of those newcomers, Ed graciously
            answered the age-old question of where to start with the Yakuza
            series.

            <br /><br />
            Like A Dragon Ishin is available now on Steam for £55/€60/$60.
