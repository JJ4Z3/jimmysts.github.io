        <h3>About This Game</h3>
        <img src="images/course6gif.gif" alt="" />
        <p>
          In Yakuza 6, Kazuma Kiryu will find out exactly how much people are
          willing to sacrifice for family - be those ties through blood or bond
          - when he investigates a series of shadowy events that involve the
          ones he holds closest to his heart. Fresh out of a three-year prison
          sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his
          surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he
          looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in
          Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and
          now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that Haruka
          now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand, Kiryu
          journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the
          truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima
          yakuza are harboring.
          <br />

        <p>
          From the unparalleled realism of the new setting of Onomichi, a
          beautiful, sleepy port town in Hiroshima Prefecture, to the latest
          evolution of Kamurocho, the biggest red-light district in Tokyo,
          Yakuza 6 is the ultimate iteration the game's blend of gritty crime
          story, hyper-explosive combat, and all the vices and distractions
          those locales have to offer.
          <br /><br />
          Enter the ‚ÄúDragon Engine‚Äù - Explore the world of Yakuza like never
          before. Yakuza 6 is the first current-gen Yakuza title that was
          developed from the ground up for the current-gen hardware, introducing
          the seedy Japanese underworld with detailed visuals, lifelike
          animations, a new physics engine, interactive storefronts, seamless
          transitions and more.
          <br /><br />
          Explore Kamurocho Reborn and the Scenic Views of Onomichi - The
          hypnotic lights, opportunistic inhabitants, and hedonistic
          distractions of Kamurocho look better than ever. Revamped minigames
          like karaoke, batting cages, darts, hostesses, and the SEGA arcade
          have been streamlined for maximum pleasure, and new additions like the
          RIZAP Gym, Cat Caf√©, and Clan Creator are the purrfect distractions
          after a long night of bashing heads! But it‚Äôs also time to get away
          from the hustle and bustle of city life to play tourist in beautiful
          Onomichi. This tranquil coastal community is home to plenty of local
          activities like bar mingling, spearfishing (think action-packed rail
          shooter ‚Ä¶ with fish), and more!

          Let the Bodies Hit the Floor - Yakuza 6 Kiryu is a 100% certified
          badass, so that means he‚Äôs a battle-hardened veteran when it comes to
          the art of street fighting. Although he utilizes one fighting style
          this time around, you best believe Kiryu hits like a truck.
          Devastating combos and bone-breaking Heat Actions make a return, but
          now the Dragon of Dojima can fill up a meter to engage Extreme Heat
          Mode. When activated, Kiryu glows blue and unleashes heavy-damage
          combos with his fists or any ‚Äútool‚Äù that‚Äôs close at hand.
          <br /><br />
          Fully Voiced Japanese Audio - For the first time in series history,
          every line and piece of dialogue is fully voiced in Japanese. Let the
          dramatic story and absurd humor of the series unfold like an
          interactive foreign film experience.
